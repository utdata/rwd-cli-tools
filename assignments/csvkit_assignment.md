Csvkit assignment
=================

Remember the csvkit lecture we just went through using the Quarterly Hotel data? I want you to do the same thing with the monthly data for 2015.

You goal is the create a new Jupyter Notebook that downloads and processes all the 12 monthly hotel files into a single file with just the Austin hotels, and then show me

* The top 10 monthly Total Room Receipts.
* The full csvstat results.

You should be able to follow the example lecture, with a couple of notable exceptions:

* Make sure you create a new project folder so you don't overwrite the `hotels`  example.
* You are starting with 12 files instead of just 4.
* You are pulling monthly files and the file names differ a little. There are hints to deal with that in the [curl man page](http://man.cx/curl).

You'll be submitting your Jupyter Notbook file to me, which I should then be able to run and reproduce your results.
